Clients slider 
=================

A random image picker choosing 4 images from an image collection changing every 5 seconds. 

The idea of this little project is that there are not duplicated images in a row - so there can be only ABCD not ABBC. 
The second condition is that the set of images changes after some time eg every 5 seconds.

The project can be used for example to present a list of clients on a webpage or as images presentation etc.
